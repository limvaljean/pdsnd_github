Title of this project: Bikeshare

The project is aimed at making use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

I used three excel files containing bikeshare data for three major cities -- Chicago, New York, and Washington.
